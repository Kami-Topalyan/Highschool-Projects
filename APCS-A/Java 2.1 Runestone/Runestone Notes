Java has constructors called object, attributes, class, behaviors

Ä°n addition I learn that you can have as man objects as you need in Java

I learned how to use the turtle library and learned how to create turtle objects.

I created squares with turtle and learned how to make bigger and smaller squares.

Then learned alot about classes.
